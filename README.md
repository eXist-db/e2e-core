# Integration test for core-apps
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/eXist-db/e2e-core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/eXist-db/e2e-core)[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/bbf3f43632c74320ae9c889cc2a689ab)](https://www.codacy.com/app/eXist-db/e2e-core_2?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=eXist-db/e2e-core&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

These tests use [cypress.js](https://www.cypress.io) to inspect the pages of the default apps inside a running exist instance.

## Requirements
*   node >= `10`
*   for local development a running exist instance:
    *   at port: `8080`
    *   with default admin user and pw

To install cypress from inside this folder call:
```bash
npm i
```

## Running cypress
When developing tests locally, navigate inside this folder in your CLI:
use either:
```bash
npx cypress open
```
or
```bash
npm run cypress
```
To bring up the interactive test client.

Tests are also automatically executed on Travis.
Test runs are linked to the [cypress dashboard](https://dashboard.cypress.io/#/projects/w23pgu/runs). To access the dashboard log-in with your Github credentials.

## What this is
This is to serve as a central place to develop e2e tests which will then be added to the respective repos.

The autodeployed apps are:
*   eXide
*   monex
*   Usermanager (deprec.)
*   Dashboard
    *   Backup Central (deprec.)
    *   Collection Browser (deprec.)
    *   Package Manager (deprec.)

A test scaffold for each of these can be found inside `cypress/integration/*` along with some boilerplate templates in `cypress/`.

We currently support two test suites, for the deprecated and upcoming new version of the Dashboard apps. Depending on your version of exist-db you need to execute the matching test suite, either:
*   `npm test -- --spec "cypress/integration/4.x.x/**"`
or
*   `npm test -- --spec "cypress/integration/5.x.x/**"`

Note the use of `--` to pass arguments to `npm test`

!Warning! Cypress does not natively support shadow-dom elements, the provided custom commands still lack polish.

## What this isn't
Integration testing within a browser are not a good fit for performance testing of java code. For stress tests and performance tests, visit [e2e-exist](https://github.com/eXist-db/e2e-exist)

This repo will never add apps that aren't in exist-db's auto-deploy folder on a fresh install. To add similar tests to your own apps, see the scaffolding of the [yeoman generator](https://github.com/eXist-db/generator-exist)
